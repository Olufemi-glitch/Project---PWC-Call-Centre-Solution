Data Analysis Project: Call Center Performance Dashboard

Project Overview

This project aims to empower employees through digital skill acceleration by leveraging data analytics. As part of the PwC Virtual Experience (The Call Centre Solution), we will develop a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key call center performance metrics. The goal is to provide actionable insights into customer satisfaction, agent efficiency, and service trends.

Objective
Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard for Claire that displays key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends in call center operations. The dashboard should enable decision-making by highlighting areas for improvement and efficiency.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard will include, but is not limited to, the following KPIs:

Customer Satisfaction – Trends in overall satisfaction ratings.
Call Handling Metrics – Calls answered, abandoned, and categorized by time.
Average Speed of Answer – Trends in response time and potential improvements.
Agent Performance Analysis
Performance Quadrant: Correlating average handle time with the number of calls answered.
Identifying top-performing and underperforming agents.


Data Insights & Analysis
Speed of Answer Trends

The sum of speed of answers in seconds declined between March 27, 2021 – March 31, 2021.
Significant contributors to this trend:
Agents Dan, Becky, and Greg had a decline in performance.
Agents Diane and Martha improved their response times.
Satisfaction Ratings Decline

Customer satisfaction ratings dropped by 82 points from March 26, 2021 – March 31, 2021.
Primary reasons:
Topics related to Technical Support and Admin Support had the largest negative impact.
Categories such as Payment-related, Technical Support, and Contract-related showed notable changes.
Agent Performance – Speed of Answer Analysis

The overall sum of speed of answers stands at 273,729 seconds.
Agent Stewart has the lowest total response time at 31,570 seconds, indicating a need for further evaluation and potential training.


Conclusion & Recommendations
Targeted Agent Training:
Agents such as Stewart require further coaching to improve call-handling speed.
Performance improvement strategies should be implemented for agents with declining response rates.
Customer Support Optimization:
Address inefficiencies in Technical Support and Admin Support, as these significantly impact customer satisfaction.
KPI Monitoring & Continuous Improvement:
Regularly update the Power BI dashboard to track improvements in call center performance.
Implement proactive strategies to enhance customer experience and response efficiency.
This project demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making in optimizing customer service operations.
